1. unhosted architecture, libraries, advice
2. dropbox, oauth, cookies. still not sure if autologin will work.
3. demo of dropbox: okay, at least I can connect to it.
4. data structures for queues. refresher on JS / ES6 updates
5. start a journal
6. responsive / flexbox studies
7. start using jquery. consider jquery UI for animation but --  later
8. visualize list items
9. copy CSS / structure from an online example so I don't have to figure out design
10. get 'add more' button working
11. get status changes / CSS in
12. get delete button working (copying template more) - sets to cancelled or clears out
13. edit button: sets to contenteditable; put text into a div
14. add an 'editing' state and adjust how things visualize
15. support clicking in/out of editing boxes and enter presses
16. add age strings (1h, 1w, etc)
17. change everything to divs + figure out how to get them to flow correctly
18. add selection, two clicks = check off (for mobile, mainly)
19. animate selection borders / fix so they don't reflow anything
20. add hints for how selection works
21. use html5 templates instead of constructing everything in JS
22.	make editing buttons look better -- cover 100% of vertical size with line-height
23. check button on elements
24. got dragging working -- after some pain. had to use globals.
25. create a drag clone to hold position; when drag is released move to that position.
26. added X to trash items; changed drop event to fire on whole document.
26. attach reference to underlying data to Dom nodes
27. priorities update to 'fit in' with neighbors when dragged (+ blink a bit), plus update on underlying data
[weeklong absence]
28. arrow keys change selection
29. update priorities in 1s; propagate them on the list.
30. design decisions:
	should double clicking edit? or clicking and holding? should double clicking change status?
	clicking and holding has to start dragging, so that can't do anything else.
	so maybe doubleclick = edit. single click = check?
	for cancelled items, no checkmark, just a 'return to active' button?
	* clicking should toggle completion
	* swiping should delete (on mobile) 
	* holding should toggle editing/selection (separate from dragging)
31. hold to edit. click once to toggle.
32: bug: tries to set as editing after clicks on little buttons. (problem: mousedown vs mouseup vs click)
33: bug: enter on edit box also checks/uncecks (problem: keypress vs keydown, stoppropagation vs preventdefault)

todo:
2. give lists a name
3. save lists into file


UI:
	better way to highlight finished vs in progress vs deleted
	hold to edit. double click to edit?
	enter on selection = commits
	double click to edit text or priority
	let add elements at the top or between two other elements
	right-align priorities
	be able to open other lists
	save current list
	delete current list
	add ? button to explain things
	move lis to use flexbox
	add link to my blog / explanation

	?? age vs due date? (priority = proxy for due date?)

DBX:
	load file list from dropbox; display as list of options
	load title of file as name of todo list
	load contents of file.
		error parsing -- if user modifies file?
	help menu: explain dropbox integration / select integration
	help menu: explain dropbox file format, in case user modifies anything?
	save contents back to file
	create new list (saves as file)
