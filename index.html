				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Priority-Queue.com is a minimalistic To-Do List app. It's for managing your priorities. In a queue.</p>
				<p class="indent">It uses the <a href="https://unhosted.org/">Unhosted</a> architecture: the website is completely static, and your data is stored in a place of your choosing. I use Dropbox for personal storage so I've set it up to use that for now, but there's no reason it couldn't use any other internet-accessible file system.</p>

				<p class="indent">I love and strongly encourage the Unhosted style for app architecture. Data is entirely owned by the user, at least in the sense that it never passes through a server owned by the app (Dropbox still has your data, but at least you don't have to trust a <em>new</em> entity to use the app). It also eliminates most of the complexity in making an app that runs and stays synchronized across multiple devices. And it makes it safe to 'gift' software to the public: hosting a static site is cheap-or-free, whereas running a server means monthly costs and infinite occasional maintenance (for the owner) and the chance that your data will disappear or be repurposed (for the user). And if I get tired of hosting it someday, any user can just do it. Or you can run a local version any time you want.

				<p class="indent">Creating unhosted-style apps and giving them out is, I think, a way to do something about the somewhat sorry direction software has gone, wherein everyone wants you to use their product so they can show you pointless ads (and then convince other people you're looking at those ads, even when you're not) (and trick you into clicking them), or sell your data to someone else who... wants to show you more pointless ads. It's telling that it's hard to find an honestly free and non-irritating version of mobile apps for everyday tasks like "flashlight" or "to-do list" or "metronome".</p>

				<hr/>

				<p class="indent"> I'm not a very practiced web-developer or anything like that, so I really can't vouch for the design or implementation of any of this, and it's possible some bug might randomly delete your data (but Dropbox could then restore the old version, anyway). I also haven't tried <em>at all</em> to use backwards-compatible HTML/CSS/JS, since this was also a chance to learn the fancy new stuff. And I haven't looked into accessibility at all, but would like to.</p>
